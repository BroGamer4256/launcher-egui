### What is this

This project is an attempt to create a simple and easily modifiable replacement for the launcher from [PD-Loader](https://github.com/PDModdingCommunity/PD-Loader)

This was based off the 2.6.5a release and the config options are based on that, other versions may be broken, use at your own risk

### How do I use it

Download a build from either [releases](https://github.com/BroGamer4256/launcher-egui/releases) or [github actions](https://github.com/BroGamer4256/launcher-egui/actions) then put launcher_egui.dva in plugins

You are expected to already have PD-Loader installed, this may not work otherwise
